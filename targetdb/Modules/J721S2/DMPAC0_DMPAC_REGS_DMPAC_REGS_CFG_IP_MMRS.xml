Must be easily ECO-able or controlled during fabrication.  Ideally through a top level metal mask or e-fuse. This number is maintained/owned by IP design owner.   RTL follows a numbering such as X.Y.R.Z which are explained in this table.   R changes ONLY when:  (1) PDS uploads occur which may have been due to spec changes  (2) Bug fixes occur  (3) Resets to '0' when X or Y changes.   Design team has an internal 'Z' (customer invisible) number which increments on every drop that happens due to DV and RTL updates. Z resets to 0 when R increments. " range="15 - 11" rwaccess="R"/> 
		<bitfield id="MAJOR" width="3" begin="10" end="8" resetval="0x1" description="Major Revision.   X as described in PDR with additional clarifications/definitions below. This number is owned/maintained by IP specification owner. X is part of IP numbering X.Y.R.Z.  X changes ONLY when:  (1) There is a major feature addition. An example would be adding Master Mode to Utopia Level2. The Func field (or Class/Type in old PID format) will remain the same.   X does NOT change due to:  (1) Bug fixes  (2) Change in feature parameters. " range="10 - 8" rwaccess="R"/>

		<bitfield id="MINOR" width="6" begin="5" end="0" resetval="0x0" description="Minor Revision.   Y as described in PDR with additional clarifications/definitions below.  This number is owned/maintained by IP specification owner.   Y changes ONLY when:  (1) Features are scaled (up or down). Flexibility exists in that this feature scalability may either be represented in the Y change or a specific register in the IP that indicates which features are exactly available.  (2) When feature creeps from Is-Not list to Is list. But this may not be the case once it sees silicon - in which case X will change.   Y does NOT change due to:  (1) Bug fixes  (2) Typos or clarifications  (3) major functional/feature change/addition/deletion. Instead these changes may be reflected via R, S, X as applicable.   Spec owner maintains a customer-invisible number 'S' which changes due to:  (1) Typos/clarifications  (2) Bug documentation. Note that this bug is not due to a spec change but due to implementation. Nevertheless, the spec tracks the IP bugs. An RTL release (say for silicon PG1.1) that occurs due to bug fix should document the corresponding spec number (X.Y.S) in its release notes.
