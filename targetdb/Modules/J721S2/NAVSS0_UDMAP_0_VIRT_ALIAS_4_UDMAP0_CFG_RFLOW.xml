In this mode, the DMA will save it's internal operational state back to the internal state RAM without issuing an advance operation to it's internal FIFO buffers.  This results in the DMA re-initiating the data transfer at a later time with the intention that additional free buffers and/or descriptors will have been added." range="28" rwaccess="R/W"/>

If this bit is set, the DMA will set the Protocol Specific Region Location bit in the PD and will place the Protocol Specific Words at the beginning of the data buffer.  When this mode is used, it is required that the resulting target data buffer pointer (which is calculated by adding the host_rx_sop_offset to the original buffer pointer in the Packet Descriptor) is aligned to a 32-bit boundary to avoid unwanted buffer truncation as the DMA will round up to the next 32-bit aligned boundary." range="25" rwaccess="R/W"/>

Note that for monolithic packets the value of this field must always be initialized to be greater than or equal to 4 times the maximum number of protocol specific 32-bit words that are required by any of the packet types that will be transferred by this channel. This is important as the primary purpose of this field is to ensure that space is left in the descriptor to place the protocol specific information without overwriting or being overwritten by the Rx data.
